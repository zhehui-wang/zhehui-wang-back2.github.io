      "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of data-intensive applications in data centers, the switching fabric in the inter-node network becomes significant. Silicon-photonic switching fabrics have a bright future in data centers, which offer high bandwidth, high energy efficiency, and low latency. However, integrating a high radix multi-stage switching fabric in a single chip faces challenges. A large number of waveguide crossings on the silicon photonic die causes massive power loss and introduces a tremendous amount of crosstalk noise. In this paper, we propose a chip partition optimization platform (POP), which can decrease the number of waveguide crossings and shorten the on-chip traversal distance of optical signals. Our algorithms can effectively reduce the power loss and crosstalk noise in silicon-photonic multistage switching fabrics, and help to improve the signal integrity. For example, compared with the common design, POP can achieve 33 dB improvement on average power loss, 42 dB improvement on worst-case power loss, and 39 dB improvement on worst-case signal to noise ratio, in a 1024×1024 butterfly based silicon-photonic switching fabric.",

      "abstract": "With the fast development of processor chips, power-efficient, high-bandwidth, and low-latency interchip interconnects become more and more important. Studies show that the bandwidth of traditional parallel interconnects with low I/O clock frequencies will become bottlenecks in the near future. To solve this problem, two types of high-bandwidth interchip interconnects are developed. Low-swing differential electrical interconnects have widely been used in high-speed I/O designs. On the other hand, optical interconnects promise high bandwidth, low latency, and could improve the chip pin performance for manycore processors. They are becoming potential alternatives for electrical interconnects. This paper systematically models these two types of interconnects in terms of crosstalk noises, attenuation, and receiver sensitivities. Based on the proposed models, we developed optical and electrical interfaces and links (OEIL) and an analysis tool for OEIL. The OEIL can be used to analyze the energy consumption, bandwidth density, and latency of interconnects. Analytical models are verified by the results of published experiments. It shows that the optical interconnects have much higher bandwidth densities than the electrical interconnects. With this feature, the optical interconnects can significantly reduce I/O pin count compared with the electrical interconnects. For example, they can save at least 92% signal pins when connecting chips more than 25 cm (10 in) apart. The energy consumption of optical interconnects is comparable with that of electrical interconnects, and the latency of polymer waveguide-based optical interconnects is 18% less than that of electrical interconnect.",

      "abstract": "With the fast development of inter/intra-chip optical interconnects, the gap between the data rates of electrical interconnects and optical interconnects is continuously increasing. Electrical-optical (E-O) interfaces and optical-electrical (O-E) interfaces are a pair of components that convert data between parallel electrical interconnects and serial optical interconnects. This paper holistically models and analyzes E-O and O-E interfaces in terms of energy consumption, area, and latency. Traditional interfaces, where data are converted between parallel and serial ports by serializers and deserializers (SerDes), are studied. A new type of E-O and O-E interface, which serializes and deserializes data by optical weaving technologies, are proposed alongside. Traditional interfaces will become a bottleneck for the further development of optical interconnects in the near future because of the high energy consumption and large area of SerDes necessitating new technologies. Our analysis shows that optical weaving interfaces have a better overall performance than traditional interfaces. For example, if there are 64 parallel electrical interconnects and four optical wavelengths, optical weaving interfaces can achieve a 81.6% improvement in energy consumption and a 40.8% improvement in area, compared with traditional interfaces.",

      "abstract": "Chip multiprocessor (CMP) is becoming increasingly popular in the processor industry. Efficient network-on-chip (NoC) that has similar performance to the processor cores is important in CMP design. Fat-tree-based on-chip network has many advantages over traditional mesh or torus-based networks in terms of throughput, power efficiency, and latency. It has a bright future in the development of CMP. However, the floorplan design of the fat-tree-based NoC is very challenging because of the complexity of topology. There are a large number of crossings and long interconnects, which cause severe performance degradation in the network. In electronic NoCs, the parasitic capacitance and inductance will be significant. In optical ones, large crosstalk noise and power loss will be introduced. The novel contribution of this paper is to propose a method to optimize the fat-tree floorplan, which can effectively reduce the number of crossings and minimize the interconnect length. Two types of floorplans are proposed, which could be applied to fat-tree-based networks of arbitrary size. Compared with the traditional one, our floorplans could reduce more than 87% of the crossings. Since the traversal distance for signals is related to the aspect ratio of the processor cores, we also present a method to calculate the optimum aspect ratio of the processor cores to minimize the traversal distance.",

      "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNN) on non-volatile nemory (NVM) based neuromorphic computing (NC) chips have been regarded as a promising solution in power constrained scenarios, such as Internet of Things (IoT), due to its low energy consumption. The high power efficiency of NC is due to various aspects including the non-von Neumann architecture of NC chip, low power NVM, and the event-driven computation of SNN etc., and introduces a large space for low power design exploration. Therefore, a comprehensive quantitative study of the power modelling for such neuromorphic computing system is important for low power design. In this work, we propose NCPower, an energy consumption estimator for NVM-based neuromorphic chip. We systemically developed analytical models for each module in the chip based on physical laws. We verified NCPower by comparing the analytical results with measurement results from different NVM based neuromorphic chips. The analytical result from NCPower could well match experiment results. We integrated NCPower in a SNN simulator, and analyzed the accuracy and energy consumption of both the traditional multi-spike based SNN and the novel single-spike based SNN. It shows that the single-spike model has 7X energy efficiency over the multi-spike model, while maintaining a similar accuracy under the CIFAR10 dataset. The estimator also showed that the best resistance range for the NVM resistors is 10 kOmega-100 kOmega for the multi-spike model.",

In this chapter, we introduce rack-scale optical networks (RSON), a silicon photonics enabled inter/intra-chip network for rack-scale many-core systems. RSON leverages the fact that most traffic is within rack and the high bandwidth and low-latency rack-scale optical network can improve both performance and energy efficiency. We codesign the intra-chip and inter-chip optical networks together with optical internode interface to provide balanced data access to both local memory and remote note's memory, making the nodes within rack cooperate effectively. The evaluations show that RSON can improve the overall performance and energy efficiency dramatically. Specifically, RSON can deliver as much as 5.4x more performance under the same energy consumption compared to traditional InfiniBand connected rack.",

      "abstract": "Rack-scale computing systems are promising to undertake the emerging large-scale applications by distributing massive tasks to processing cores. The communication and coordination efficiency of these tasks and resources directly affect the system performance and energy consumption. Silicon photonic interconnects are expected to address the communication and system power consumption challenges imposed on rack-scale systems. However, the control for optical interconnects can cause server performance degradation if not properly designed, especially for the complicated and time-consuming multidomain networks. In this paper, we study the optical interconnects for rack-scale computing systems and propose a new communication flow and control scheme for the efficient coordination of distributed resources. Particularly, we first propose a forward propagation strategy that parallels the path reservation process with the distributed tasks connection setup. Second, we develop a pre-emptive chain feedback (PCF) scheme to optimize multidomain path reservation. The PCF scheme pre-emptively allocates network resources with the help of multicell reservation window and quickly releases resources with a feedback mechanism. This solution increases the network resources utilization and task coordination efficiency while minimizing path reservation overheads. Comparing to the baseline InfiniBand network fabric and handshake scheme, PCF can improve network throughput greatly under uniform and hotspot traffic patterns. Realistic benchmark results show that the PCF scheme on average reduces 52% and 60% energy consumption per unit system performance than InfiniBand and the handshake scheme for a 256-node rack system.",

These networks employ the microresonators (MRs) to modulate, direct, or detect the optical signal. However, utilized MRs suffer from intrinsic crosstalk noise and signal power loss, degrading the network efficiency via the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The amount of crosstalk noise and signal power loss may differ from network to network. Hence, there exists a need to systematically analyze the effect of the crosstalk noise and the power loss issues. In this paper, we have developed the analytical models considering both coherent and incoherent crosstalk for both the interchip and intrachip optical networks. The interchip/intrachip optical interconnection networks-the I2CON-are analyzed as a case study. The quantitative results on the individual networks have demonstrated that the architectural design determines the impact of crosstalk on the SNR. We have also demonstrated that the optical interconnection networks with interchip/intrachip interconnects result in better bit error rate (BER) compared with that of only intrachip interconnect. Our analyses of the worst case can be utilized as a platform to compare the realistic performance among different optical interconnection networks via the degradation of SNR/BER and data bandwidth.",

With the development of silicon photonics for short-haul optical communication, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-based optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) are emerging on-chip communication architectures that can potentially offer high bandwidth and power efficiency. Thermal sensitivity of photonic devices is one of the main concerns about the on-chip optical interconnects. We systematically modeled thermal effects in optical links in WDM-based ONoCs. Based on the proposed thermal models, we developed OTemp, an optical thermal effect modeling platform for optical links in both WDM-based ONoCs and single-wavelength ONoCs. OTemp can be used to simulate the power consumption as well as optical power loss for optical links under temperature variations. We use case studies to quantitatively analyze the worst-case power consumption for one wavelength in an eight-wavelength WDM-based optical link under different configurations of low-temperature-dependence techniques. Results show that the worst-case power consumption increases dramatically with on-chip temperature variations. Thermal-based adjustment and optimal device settings can help reduce power consumption under temperature variations. Assume that off-chip vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers are used as the laser source with WDM channel spacing of 1 nm, if we use thermal-based adjustment with guard rings for channel remapping, the worst-case total power consumption is 6.7 pJ/bit under the maximum temperature variation of 60°C; larger channel spacing would result in a larger worst-case power consumption in this case. If we use thermal-based adjustment without channel remapping, the worst-case total power consumption is around 9.8 pJ/bit under the maximum temperature variation of 60°C; in this case, the worst-case power consumption would benefit from a larger channel spacing.",
